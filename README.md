- 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Ehrich
- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development, api design, cloud architecture and infrastructure, dev ops, ci/cd, microservices, typescript, nestjs, openapi and list goes on and on... :) Anything going inside the stack and going from an idea to production.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning event driven architecture with the cqrs principle and event streams. Also looking into front end frameworks like svelte
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun :)
